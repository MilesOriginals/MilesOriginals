## Hello world âœ¨

I'm Miles, an artist and youtuber who talks about art and tech among ohter things.
I want to publish here my codes about projects I am working on to share with the community.
Feel free to comment, modify or anything that Github allows to make the code better ! (but on branches plz)
I am still fairly new to Github and coding in general, so bear with me as I will do goofy stuff.
